# Arduino calculator
Made on board Crowduino ATMega328 V1.1 (Arduino UNO)
Can multiply, divide, add and subtract
My first project.

## Components:
- Crowduino
- 4x4 button matrix
- LCD1602
- Potentiometer (to adjust contrast)
- breadboard (830 points, you can use a much smaller one)
- jumpwires

## How to connect?
### LCD1602
- Vss - Ground
- Vdd - 5V
- V0 - middle pin of potentiometer
- RS - 3
- RW - Ground
- E - 5
- D4 - 6
- D5 - 7
- D6 - 8
- D7 - 9
- A - 5V
- K - Ground

## 4x4 matrix
- C4 - 12
- C3 - 11 
- C2 - 10
- C1 - A1
- R1 - A2
- R2 - A3
- R3 - A4
- R4 - A5

## Potentiometer 
- left pin - Ground
- righ pin   - 5V

## How it works?
Reads numbers from a 4x4 keypad, displays them on an LCD1602, and performs basic arithmetic operations.


## Plans 
- Identify and fix bug in logic.
